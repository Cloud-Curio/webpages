    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Warm Neutral Harmony" - A calming palette with a light beige background, slate for text, subtle terracotta for primary actions, and gentle sage/sky for highlights. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dynamic "Rule Explorer" dashboard. The structure prioritizes task-oriented discovery over the source report's linear narrative. A top-level filter bar allows users to instantly select rules by category (e.g., Security, Testing). A real-time search bar provides granular highlighting of keywords. This non-linear, interactive approach was chosen because the primary user need is to quickly find specific, actionable guidance from a large set of rules, rather than reading the document from start to finish. This design transforms a static report into a practical, on-demand developer tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The core of the application is an interactive grid of "Rule Cards" built with HTML/Tailwind and managed by JS. Goal: Organize/Inform. Interaction: Category filtering and keyword search. Justification: This is the most effective way to make 67 discrete text blocks navigable. Summary tables are presented in clean, collapsible HTML sections. Goal: Compare/Inform. Interaction: Show/Hide toggle. Justification: This presents dense comparative data clearly without cluttering the primary rule explorer interface. NO charts were used as the data is primarily textual and categorical, making interactive text presentation the superior method. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
